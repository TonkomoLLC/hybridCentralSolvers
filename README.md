Latest OpenFOAM version: 4.1

1. **pimpleCentralFoam** - Pressure-based semi implicit compressible flow solver based on central-upwind schemes of
Kurganov and Tadmor with LTS support for steady-state calculations

2. **pimpleCentralDyMFoam** - Pressure-based semi implicit compressible flow solver based on central-upwind schemes of
Kurganov and Tadmor with mesh motion and LTS support for steady-state calculations

3. **reactingPimpleCentralFoam** - Pressure-based semi implicit compressible flow solver based on central-upwind schemes of 
Kurganov and Tadmor for combustion with chemical reactions and LTS support for steady-state calculations

4. **multiRegionReactingPimpleCentralFoam** - Pressure-based semi implicit compressible flow solver based on central-upwind
schemes of Kurganov and Tadmor for combustion with chemical reactions and LTS support for steady-state calculations.  
MultiRegion version includes solid heat conduction with conjugate heat transfer between solid and fluid regions.
